## Introduction

Welcome to my Todo app project repository! This project is part of the challenges offered by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), aimed at improving coding skills by building real-world projects.

Throughout this project, I've gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as honing my design skills to create a user-friendly and visually appealing Todo app.

## Project Overview

The challenge was to build a Todo app that closely resembles the provided design. The app should be fully responsive, with interactive elements that include hover states. Users should be able to add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, filter tasks by all/active/complete status, clear all completed tasks, and toggle between light and dark modes. As a bonus, I also implemented drag and drop functionality to reorder items on the task list.

## What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned and improved upon several key skills and concepts:

1. **Responsive Design**: I focused on creating a layout that adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

2. **JavaScript Interactivity**: I implemented various JavaScript functionalities to make the app dynamic, such as adding and removing tasks, managing task status, and filtering tasks based on their completion status.

3. **Styling and User Experience**: I paid close attention to the styling details, including hover states and transitions, to enhance the user experience and make the app visually appealing.

4. **Local Storage**: To ensure task persistence, I used browser local storage to save and load task data, allowing users to return to the app and see their tasks as they left them.

5. **Dark Mode Implementation**: I integrated a dark mode feature to enhance usability during nighttime hours.

6. **Drag and Drop Functionality**: As a bonus feature, I implemented drag and drop functionality to enable task reordering, making the app even more user-friendly.

7. **Project Planning**: I started by planning the project structure and creating an HTML structure before diving into CSS and JavaScript. This helped me stay organized and maintain clean and reusable code.
